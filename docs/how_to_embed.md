# How to Create and Query a Personal Knowledge Base

This guide explains how to create your own searchable knowledge base from HTML files.

## Step 1: Collect HTML Files

- Download the HTML file [Prompt engineering: overview and guide](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-prompt-engineering) and some htmls from [www.zhouzhengxi.com](https://www.zhouzhengxi.com)
- Place all HTML files in the `sources` folder

## Step 2: Create the Vector Database

Run the embedding script to convert your HTML files into a searchable database:

```bash
```bash
âžœ  personal-rag git:(master) âœ— python embedding.py
âœ… Loaded Stand on Tiptoes.html: 16 characters
âœ… Loaded Prompt Engineering for AI Guide _ Google Cloud.html: 57895 characters
âœ… Loaded Spend $0.05 to Change the Voice of a Song.html: 16 characters
âœ… Loaded Try Stable Diffusion.html: 16 characters
âœ… Loaded 4 documents.
âœ… After splitting, got 132 chunks.

First chunk content sample (first 100 chars): 
Stand on Tiptoes...

âœ… Embedding model loaded successfully.
âœ… Created vector database with 132 documents.
ðŸŽ‰ Vector database saved successfully to folder html_faiss_index!
```

What this does:
- Loads all HTML files from the `sources` folder
- Extracts the text content from each file
- Splits text into smaller chunks
- Creates vector embeddings for each chunk
- Saves everything in the `html_faiss_index` folder

## Step 3: Search Your Knowledge Base

Run the query script to search your knowledge base:

```bash
```bash
âžœ  personal-rag git:(master) âœ— python query.py
Loading embedding model and vector database...

âœ… Vector database loaded successfully!

- Type any question or keywords
- The system finds the most relevant text from your HTML files
- Results are displayed with relevance scores
- Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end

## How It Works

1. The system uses AI embeddings to convert text into numerical vectors
2. Similar content has similar vector representations
3. When you search, your question is converted to a vector
4. The system finds text chunks with the closest matching vectors
5. Results are ranked by similarity score

## Tips

- Add more HTML files to expand your knowledge base
- Be specific with your search queries
- Use keywords related to your content
- Run `embedding.py` again whenever you add new files
